# MovieUnpacker
Simple tool to process folders with multipart RAR files from scene releases.

Will automatically uncompress Subs folder, and symlink files when the folder contains just an mkv file, to avoid copying files.

Useful as a "script-torrent-done-filename" processor for NAS devices, when you have a "movies" folder for unpacked files.

This of course can be replaced with a simple bash script, but I love using Visual Studio and C#.
